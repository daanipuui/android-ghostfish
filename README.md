Dependency injection container for Android

## 1. Annotations

- `ApplicationScoped` - specifies that a bean is application scoped.
- `Inject` - injectable instance fields or constructors.
- `PostConstruct` - method that needs to be run after instantiating an application scoped bean.

## 2. Dependency injection

Using annotation processors, GhostFish compiles a list of application scoped beans in *asset/beans.txt* file.

During this stage, it also adds code allowing dependency injection to every non-bean class containing at least 1 `@Inject` annotation.

## 3. Example

### 3.1 Add GhostFish dependency to your gradle file:

```
implementation "com.danielpuiu:ghostfish:1.1.0"
annotationProcessor "com.danielpuiu:ghostfish-compiler:1.1.0"
```

### 3.2 Add GhostFish bind call to your application

Subclass Android application and add the following code to `onCreate` method:

```
@Override
public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();

    GhostFish.bind(this);
}
```

Don't forget to add this class to your manifest file right under `application` tag

```
<application
    ...
    android:name="<class_name>"
    ...
```

### 3.3 Proguard

If you use Proguard and minified, then make sure to add the following rule to your proguard rules file:

```
-keep @com.danielpuiu.ghostfish.annotations.ApplicationScoped class * {*;}
```

### 3.4 Sample code

#### 3.4.1 Service class

```
@ApplicationScoped
public class SampleService {

    public String helloWorld() {
        return "Hello, world!";
    }

    @PostConstruct
    private void init() {
        // code
    }
}
```

#### 3.4.2 Activity class

```
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Inject
    private SampleService sampleService;
    
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        ...
        TextView textView = findViewById(R.id.message);
        textView.setText(sampleService.helloWorld());
        ...
    }
}
```
